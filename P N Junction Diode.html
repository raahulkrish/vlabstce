              Identify the P substrate and N substrate <br><br>
              To start, Click the 'Form P-N Junction' button given below <br>
              and observe the changes.  
              </div>
              <div id="step2">
              While combining both flavours during fabrication, a junction is formed between p-region and n-region.
              Click "Diffusion" button to see further changes in an unbiased PN junction diode.        
              </div>
              <div id="step3">
                Immediately after the junction is formed, due to non-uniform concentration on both sides, 
                electrons and holes starts moving across the junction. This is Diffusion. 
                Now, click "Apply Voltage" button to see uniform doping concentration after diffusion.           
              </div>
              <div id="step4">
                Immobile charges are accumulated near the junction and acts as a barrier (depletion region) and stops the flow 
                of charge carriers across the junction.
                We need charge carriers flow across the junction to make the device ON. So what are you waiting for, 
                vary the voltage slider to see what is coming up.  
              </div>
              <div id="step5">
                YES ! Now the flow of electrons and holes across the junction is <strong>RESTARTED</strong>
                which is nothing but the charge carriers has gained energy more than the barrier potential
                and thus the force towards the depletion region will be more making the depletion region 
                thinner.
              </div>
              <div id="step6">
                As we observe while increasing voltage across the diode, 
                more free electrons gets generated thus mobility of electrons increases and current also increases.
              </div>
              <div id="step7">
                At some point more electrons in the junction lead to velocity saturation and thus speed saturates. 
                So, after this even for a small amount of voltage there will be huge current growing exponentially.

                  They need only small amount of energy to release the electrons from the valence shell.<br><br>
                  The electrons which are released from the valence shell are free electrons.

                          Why Group V ?<br><br>
                          Because they have 5 electrons in their valence shell.<br><br>
                          While forming covalent bond, they leave the 5th electron in the valence band\.<br><br>
                          In the same fashion, we can create holes by adding Group III impurities.<br><br>
                          Because they have only three valence electrons, leaving the 4th place as a hole in the covalent bond.

            <strong>Step 3:</strong>      
              Gradually increase the supply voltage from 0V in steps of 0.5 V till 0.65 V by varying the voltage slider and note down the meter readings shown below. Observe the changes happening inside the device.

              Now the Applied voltage is greater than the cut-in voltage of the diode and it starts conducting.
